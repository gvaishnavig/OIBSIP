# Java Projects - Oasis Infobyte Internship

This repository contains the Java projects I developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The projects demonstrate my understanding of Java and its application in creating interactive and user-friendly applications.

## Project 1: Number Guessing Game

The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet exciting game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess it. The game limits the number of attempts given to the user, making it an engaging way to understand the implementation of random number generation and user input in Java.

### Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Prompts the user to guess the number.
- Multiple rounds.

## Project 2: Online Examination System

The Online Examination System is a comprehensive platform that simulates the experience of an online exam. It is designed with features that ensure a smooth and efficient examination process.

### Features
- User Login: Secure access for each user.
- Profile Update: Allows users to update their profile information.
- Password Update: Provides users with the option to change their password.
- Timer: Each exam has a set duration, after which the exam is auto-submitted.
